# Bun2Nix sample

Example project created with `bun init` to show usage of `bun2nix`, a fast bun package to nix expression converter written in rust.

This project builds a simple hello world binary that logs some text to the console, but it has some conflicting dependencies:
- `lru-cache` => version `5.1.1`.
- `cacache@18.0.4` => which needs `lru-cache` version `10.4.3`.

If you try this out locally, after `bun install`, `lru-cache` in `./node_modules` should have version `5.1.1` and `lru-cache` in `./node_modules/cacache/node_modules` should have version `10.4.3`. Naturally, we must expect that the `node_modules` directory generated by `bun2nix` should inherit this.

To try it out use `nix run .`.

Expected output should be:
`
Hello from lru-cache
Hello from cacache
`
