# Building with `mkBunDerivation`

`mkBunDerivation` is provided as a library function to build bun packages from the file generated by the [bun2nix command line tool](./using-the-command-line-tool.md).

## Example

Currently, basic usage would look something like:

```nix
{mkBunDerivation, ...}:
mkBunDerivation {
  pname = "simple-bun-app";
  version = "1.0.0";

  src = ./.;

  bunNix = ./bun.nix;

  index = "index.ts";
}
```

or, in the more implicit style:

```nix
{mkBunDerivation, ...}:
mkBunDerivation {
  packageJson = ./package.json;
  src = ./.;
  bunNix = ./bun.nix;
}
```

> NOTE: building with the implicit `package.json` values makes a number of basic assumptions about your project that it expects to hold true in the name of convenience. Approximately, these are:
>
> - `name` is a field that is acceptable for use as the name of the binary produced by your package.
> - `version` is a field denoting your package version in proper semantic versioning.
> - `module` is a field pointing towards your `index.ts file or equivalent.
If you notice any strange errors while using the implict build scheme try specifying the values manually and contribute a new descriptive assert message to `mkBunDerivation`.

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packageJson` | (Optional) Your project's `package.json`. If supplied can be used to complete `pname`, `version` and `index` instead of requiring them manually.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `pname`       | (Optional) The name of the package to build. Required if `packageJson` is not given.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `version`     | (Optional) Your package version. Required if `packageJson` is not given.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `src`         | The source code for your package                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `bunNix`      | The file generated by the `bun2nix` cli                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `index`       | (Optional) The index.{js,ts} file entry point to your bun application. If you do not have one, leave this empty and use a custom `buildPhase`. This should be a string containing the relative path from `src`. Required if `packageJson` is not given.                                                                    |
| `buildFlags`  | Optional flags to pass into `bun build` in the default `buildPhase`. By default these flags are `[ "--compile" "--minify" "--sourcemap" "--bytecode" ]`. If you have issues with your build try removing some of them or [read the bun documentation on single file executables](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/executables). |
