# Building Packages

`bun2nix` provides a simple helper derivation builder to help building packages with it's generated `bun.nix` file.

## Building with `mkBunDerivation`

`mkBunDerivation` is provided as a library function to build bun packages from the file generated by the [bun2nix command line tool](./using-the-command-line-tool.md).

Currently, basic usage would look something like:

```nix
{mkBunDerivation, ...}:
mkBunDerivation {
  pname = "simple-bun-app";
  version = "1.0.0";

  src = ./.;

  bunNix = ./bun.nix;

  index = "index.ts";
}
```

or, in the more implicit style:

```nix
{mkBunDerivation, ...}:
mkBunDerivation {
  packageJson = ./package.json;
  src = ./.;
  bunNix = ./bun.nix;
}
```

> NOTE: building with the implicit `package.json` values makes a number of basic assumptions about your project that it expects to hold true in the name of convenience. Approximately, these are:
>
> - `name` is a field that is acceptable for use as the name of the binary produced by your package.
> - `version` is a field denoting your package version in proper semantic versioning.
> - `module` is a field pointing towards your `index.ts file or equivalent.
If you notice any strange errors while using the implict build scheme try specifying the values manually and contribute a new descriptive assert message to `mkBunDerivation`.

| Argument      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packageJson` | (Optional) Your project's `package.json`. If supplied can be used to complete `pname`, `version` and `index` instead of requiring them manually.                                                                                                        |
| `pname`       | (Optional) The name of the package to build. Required if `packageJson` is not given.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `version`     | (Optional) Your package version. Required if `packageJson` is not given.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `src`         | The source code for your package                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `bunNix`      | The file generated by the `bun2nix` cli                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `index`       | (Optional) The index.{js,ts} file entry point to your bun application. If you do not have one, leave this empty and use a custom `buildPhase`. This should be a string containing the relative path from `src`. Required if `packageJson` is not given. |
| `buildFlags`  | Optional flags to pass into `bun build` in the default `buildPhase`                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Building with your own builder function

If you wish to attempt building with your own derivation function, there are some important things you may wish to know:

1. `bun.nix` contains a list of package metadata that has all you need to construct a `node_modules` directory for a given package.
2. This can be produced with the `mkBunNodeModules` library function provided by `bun2nix`.
