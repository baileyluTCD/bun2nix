# Installation

Bun2nix is primarily distributed as a [nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes) library that contains everything you need to package your bun application with the tool.

This can be setup in two ways:
- [From a template](./template-installation.md)
- [In a pre-existing flake](./flake-installation.md)
